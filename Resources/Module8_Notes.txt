Objective: 

The amazing Prime team would like to develop an algorithm that will predict which low budget movies being released will become popular so they can buy
the streaming rights at a bargin. 

Working with two data sources. 
	A scrape of Wikipedia for all movies released since 1990 & rating data from movielands website. 

Extract: read the data, often from multiple sources. 
Transform: clean and structure the data in desired form. 
Load: Write the data into a database for storage. 

To load the raw JSON into a list of dictionaries, we will use the load() method.

Transform: Should have three steps. 
	- Inspect, Plan, Execute. 
Created a function. 

Function: Variables created outside the function are called global variables. 
	  Variables created inside the function are local variables. 
	 The hierarchy of variables is called the scope. 

EXAMPLE: 

x = 'global value'

def foo():
    x = 'local value'
    print(x)

foo()
print(x)

Lambda: lambda functions are written in one line and automatically return a value without using the return keyword. 

EXAMPLE: 

lambda arguments: expression.
